Translation, an ancient art

The history of translation is almost as old as that of the language
written. Over the centuries, peoples and societies have developed
languages spoken. Since these peoples have been confronted with
to each other, they have developed translation methods to
be able to communicate. Translation of texts has played a crucial role in
facilitating communication and knowledge sharing between
different cultures.

Early examples of text translation date back to civilizations
ancient such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, where multilingual texts


were used for trade and diplomacy. During the
Translation has become an important tool for the dissemination of
knowledge and ideas throughout Europe, the works of authors
Greek and Roman classics being translated into Latin. In the Renaissance, the
translation has played a crucial role in language development
modern European scholars seeking to grasp the nuances and
complexities of ancient texts.
In the modern era, the advent of technology allowed fast translation
real-time text, making communication beyond it easier than ever
language barriers.
Whether simple sentences or complex technical documents, the
translation of texts has become an essential tool for
companies and governments.

This problem having aroused our curiosity, we decide to create our
own text translation tool. we know this is clearly not
an easy task, we will neither translate the text yourself, nor use artificial intelligence models to translate it automatically.
What to do? Well donâ€™t panic! We used an API to do this!
